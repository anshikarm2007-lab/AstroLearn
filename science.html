                        concepts: [

                                explanation: "Matter is anything that has mass (weight) and takes up space (volume). Everything you can see, touch, or feel is made of matter. Even things you can't see, like air, are matter because they have mass and take up space.",
                                example: "A book is matter because it has weight and takes up space. The air around you is also matter, even though you can't see it!"

                                explanation: "Matter exists in three main states: solid, liquid, and gas. Solids have a fixed shape and volume (like ice or wood). Liquids have a fixed volume but take the shape of their container (like water or oil). Gases have no fixed shape or volume and spread out to fill their container (like air or steam).",
                                example: "Ice is a solid (fixed shape), water is a liquid (takes container shape), and steam is a gas (fills the container)."

                                explanation: "Matter can change from one state to another through heating or cooling. When you heat a solid, it melts into a liquid. When you heat a liquid, it evaporates into a gas. When you cool a gas, it condenses into a liquid. When you cool a liquid, it freezes into a solid.",
                                example: "Ice (solid) melts into water (liquid) when heated. Water (liquid) freezes into ice (solid) when cooled. Water (liquid) evaporates into steam (gas) when heated."

                                explanation: "All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms and molecules. In solids, particles are packed tightly together and vibrate in place. In liquids, particles are close together but can move around. In gases, particles are far apart and move freely.",
                                example: "Think of a solid like people standing close together in a line, a liquid like people walking around in a room, and a gas like people spread out across a large field."

You inherit one allele from each parent for each gene. The combination of alleles determines your traits. For example, there are alleles for brown eyes (B) and blue eyes (b).",

Phenotype is the physical appearance or expression of the trait (what you actually see, like brown eyes or blue eyes). The genotype determines the phenotype, but the same phenotype can come from different genotypes.",

Light reactions capture energy and produce ATP and NADPH. The Calvin cycle uses these to make glucose.",

This ensures each new cell gets a complete copy of DNA.",

DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which carries instructions to ribosomes. Ribosomes read mRNA and assemble amino acids into proteins according to the genetic code.",
                                example: "A gene in DNA is transcribed to mRNA, which travels to a ribosome where it's translated into a specific protein that performs a function in the cell."
